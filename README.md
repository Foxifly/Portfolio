# Portfolio Project
#### Lindsay Ciastko

## Introduction
This project was designed to be a personal job portfolio for me, Lindsay Ciastko. It outlines my educational background and project history for prospective employers to interactive with and view. This webpage was built using the React JavaScript framework. The reason for doing so was to sharpen my skills with React and learn how to build my own single page web applications. 

## Installation
To run this webpage locally, clone or download this repository onto your local machine. Navigate to the directory and run  `npm install` to install all of the dependencies from the `package.json` file. To run the development build locally, you will use `npm start` to launch it on `localhost:3000`(or whichever port is redily available). 

## Demonstration
A live demo of my portfolio can be viewed [here](https://portfolio.foxifly.net/).
