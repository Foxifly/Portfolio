This course taught me advanced topics in HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and React. At the end of the whole program, I was able to build my own accessibility-friendly map application, Spur of the Moment, that integrated with the Google Maps, Yelp, HERE, and PetFinder APIs. Though there were some challenging moments working on this project, I enjoyed working on it every step of the way. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with Udacity's Nanodegree.",
