I also troubleshoot software application issues by translating technical root cause, escalating when deemed as necessary. Also, I coordinated bi-weekly calls with Bullhorn's top enterprise clients to review open Support tickets to meet customer requirements. I conceptualized with the Product Management department regarding innovation on new product/feature roll-outs. Moreover, I identified high-priority issues and engaged the Product Management and Software Engineering in problem resolution. I was directly promoted into the role as a Tier 2 Support Analyst instead of starting in Tier 1 Support Analyst. Before promotion, I ended with a 99% Ticket Comment and Initial Response SLA and Consistently exceeded target metrics and received over 90% CSATs (customer surveys).
